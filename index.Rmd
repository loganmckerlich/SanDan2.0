# Welcome To Logan and Connors San Dan Plan
![What a nice view](img/IMG_1760.jpeg)

### - Desire represents how badly I want to do each of my `r paste(total)` activities
### - Time represents my estimated time each activity will take in hours
##### -All things told I have `r paste(tot.time)` hours total, better not mess around down there.
### - Activites are listed to the right of the plot and correlate with colored dots on the plot

```{r graph, echo= FALSE}
plot_desire
```

### If that graphic doesnt make sense, here's a table
```{r table, echo = FALSE}
table
```
