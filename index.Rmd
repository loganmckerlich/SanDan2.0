# Welcome To Logan and Connors San Dan Plan
![What a nice view](img/IMG_1760.jpeg)

### - Desire represents how badly we want to do each of the `r paste(total)` activities
### - Time represents our estimated time each activity will take in hours
##### -All things told we have `r paste(tot.time)` hours of activities, better not mess around down there.
### - Activites are listed to the right of the plot and correlate with colored dots on the plot

```{r graph, echo= FALSE}
plot_desire
```

### If that graphic doesnt make sense, here's a table
```{r table, echo = FALSE}
table
```
### You may think to yourself, you're only in San Diego for 5 days, do you have time for all this?
```{r pie, echo=FALSE}
pie
```
