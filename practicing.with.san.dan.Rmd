### - Desire represents how badly I want to do each of my `r paste(total)` activities
### - Time represents my estimated time each activity will take in hours
#### - All things told I have `r paste(tot.time)` hours total, better not mess around down there.
### - Activites are listed to the right of the plot and correlate with colored dots on the plot

```{r graph, echo= FALSE}
plot_desire
```

### If that graphic doesnt make sense, heres a little table
```{r table, echo = FALSE}
table
```
